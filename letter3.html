        <p>My Love,</p>
        <p>You keep asking me whether i would forgive you if you ever cheat on me, i promise you i would always forgive
            you every single time without even thinking just becuase i really love you. I mean i even forgave you after 
            i figured that you would give more importance to a stranger over me, so ofc i would forgive you when you cheat
            on me but please dont cheat on me. 
        </p>
        <p> I know im annoying and at times you wouldnt like me. I know im dumb and i understand things slowly. I know im 
            hard to explain things to. I know im not as pretty as a girl you deserve should be. I know i might not be as 
            intelligent as a girl you should be with. And i also understand that all i do is give you reasons to leave me.
        </p>
        <p>But i promise im trying. I'm trying to be less clingy, to text you less, to annoy you less, to not double text, 
            to act cool w you but idk how do i loose my compose everytime i think of you. Everytime i think of you i feel 
            so homely, so safe and as if i can tell you anything and everything. I try to learn as many new things you tell me 
            so that i dont have to question again and look dumb, but sometimes i crack up and end up looking stupid but i 
            promise im trying. I want you to please cooperate w me, ik how hard it is to explain everything but i promise i'll 
            learn, i promise i will change for you. I can not change how i look, and i for a matter of fact know that i dont 
            look good but im trying to be pretty for you, so that i look nice when i stand next to you. I promise im trying to 
            get better at everything so that you like me.
        </p>
        <p>I really love you for not going away, not giving up on me. I dont understand why do you love me inspite of 
            every second where i prove to be a disappointment. I really cherish how you try to understand when i myself
            know that i dont deserve any of the time and effort, not even one-eighth of it. 
        </p>
        <p> I am so blessed to have a person like you with me. Please dont ever leave me, i promise i will change and be better.
        </p>
