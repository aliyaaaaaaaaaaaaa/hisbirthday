        birthday i hope you have a great day and obv a great great life forever becuase you all the kindness and happiness this world has
        to offer. i hope we stay together forever but just in case if we dont then i always want you to be happyand smiling becuase YOU are 
        the reason I smile to bed everyday. i dont know if you even like me that much or not, i want you to know that I do and that should not 
        develop any pressure on you because sometime you might not like people who like you and i promise i will be okay. khair, i hope you reached 
        here (the end page) and really liked everything, becuase god i have dark circles now from staying up all night learning coding and shit 
        for you, and trust me it was NOT AT ALL easy; matlab aakhri baas i sat in some computer class it was like back in 8th grade THAT TOO 
        online so idk shit about cs. and in my view this was the best gift i could give you. so happy birthday. i love you sm.
