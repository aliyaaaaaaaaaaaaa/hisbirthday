        <p>My Love,</p>
        <p> to be with with you calms my soul. it makes me sleep better. it makes me
            dream better and not online; the dreams when I am asleep. also the
            daydreams, because you make me believe in myself and you allow me to
            dream of big unbelievable things. i would never be ashamed to share my
            deep down dreams with you, because you you are always there with wise
            word. to be with you will always be the best time I have in a day, when I
            am talking to you; all of me finally makes sense and i dont feel lost anymore 
            or alone. you have seen most of my flaws, yet you're never trying to change me 
            or leave me. to be with you is making my life so much better. to be with you makes
            me feel so alive, yet carefree and safe. to be with you is easy and effortless, it as 
            if i never have to try to fit in with you, we just go together somehow and we fit in.
            to be with you is a feeling i would never let go off and i would hold it seceretly 
            JUST for myself and be selfish about it. to be with you is realising that sometimes 
            life is really generous; offering people as good as you in my life. 
            to be with you makes us perfect for each other, complimenting each other in the rightest
            way.to be with you makes me want to run all the way to you just to hug, so to get a very 
            glimpse of you, glimpse of your smile, so that it could spark me from the inside. to be 
            with you is soothing just like long showers after a tiring day, i could tell you very single
            thing about my day and display all my emotions; without being judged by you. to be with
            you you is real. To be with you is all i would ever desire for. to be with you is all i ever 
            want. to be with you is all i would ever need
        </p>
