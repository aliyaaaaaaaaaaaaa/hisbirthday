        <p>My Love,</p>

        <p>it's 24th of nov today, and currently its 2.03 i checked my insta last at around 9 and then i texted your dis at around 12. It might 
            sound lame but i'm tell you all of that becuase rn i wanted to re read our priv chats for things and dates and i j saw you came online 
            but didnt text me. I dont want to spoil your mood or wtv but i thought of letting yk that i figured, i wouldve appreciated if you'd 
            have texted me as soon as you logged in but its alr im sure must have had your reasons and everything. And just so yk i too deactivated my 
            accounts when you went out of insta because i didnt want to waste my time talking to anyone else. I logged in day before yesterday to both 
            my accounts just so that i could find out the dates and everything of our chats you might see 2 dots in your inbox, only if you had opened it.
        </p>
        <p>Khair, you dont have to explain anything i understand you might have had your reasons just like for everything else you do. I might not always 
            tell you everything but i really do notice every single thing about you. I like you nevertheless and you dont have to explain anyhting its alr. 
            Idk if you will actually read this on your birthday, later or never but whenever you do i hope you get happy after seeing all of this tbh. 
            I dont know what else to write i mean i still cannot imagine im talking to a real person who maybe really likes me even though its over the internet
            and THAT TOO its literally YOU. I love you so much i mean fr. Like damn look at you, you're so hot istg i cannot understand how do you like me.
            But wtv, i want to always be w you, like having you is like knowing that there still exists a person who i can always reply on.
        </p>
        <p>I want you to think the same thing, i wish you can tell me any and everything. You do not share much and i have come to believe that i do not know
            much about you except; your fav colour (black), your dislikes (paratha, rasgulla *how can you call it white gualbjamun lmao*, talking back to you,
            being disrespected, light, thandi and the list goes on), favs (icecream, chocolates, dosa, gulabjamun, dal chawal and etc.), but arent they surface
            level things that everyone knows??
        </p>
        <p>I am not sure if you feel comfortable w me yet but im trying still. I hope you like me too. Okay we need to lighten up the mood and make it more yay.
            SOOOO tell me all about your plans for your birthday. I hope you have a great birthdayyy.
        </p>
