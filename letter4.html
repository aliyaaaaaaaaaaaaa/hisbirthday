        <p>My Love,</p>
        <p> Its been 358 days, 21 hours and 18 minutes, since i first texted the "jello". i texted at 31st dec, 2.42 a.m.
            and i am so greatful for every day, every minute, every second i have spent w you ever since. I have only fell
            more and more in love w you in the entire time. I am so lucky to even have you in my life tbh.
        </p>
        <p> You dont wear skippy jeans, you have fashion sense, yk nice english, you look hot; marvellous; breathtaking actually,
            youre so loving, so kind, so respectfull (disrespectful only in the right places), youre so sweet, so mature, you
            treat me like a baby, youre literally the man i used to read books about; the perfect guy to ever exist, youre tall,
            youre handsome, i love your body; muscles; arms; hands; fingers??; chest; back; every single thing, you like me, you 
            are nice to me, you make me want to trust you and tell you everything, you make me smile, you make my day, you ,ake me 
            happy and u genuinely love you, you are literally the best.
        </p>
        <p> I cherish every memory i have with you. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. I love how we spend hours on call talking about the 
            most random thing and laughing and giggling and everything. I would actually stay up all night every night to be able to
            talk to you, for you i would sacrifice my sleep, and that coming from me (a girl who skipped her examination and slept???)
            is a huge thing. I really love talking to you even when we dont have anything to talk about. I still remember when you
            stayed up till 5-6 in the morning although you wanted to sleep at 10 j so that we could watch that movie. And thankfully
            now Passenger; is my fav movie. I love every little thing you do. Every single text of yours make me like you even more.
        </p>
        <p>I love you SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much and hope you like me too even a little bit would be fine. I would try to fit in that 
            little bit also
        </p>
        <p class="signature">with all my heart, <br> mwaaah</p>
