        <p>My Love,</p>
        <p> Tbh i'm running out of things to say to you, i mean i could write a book about you; for you; to you, par abhi
            pata nhi kya ho rha hai. Matlab atp, i have millions of things to say to you but at this instant i am unable 
            to decide ke pehle kya bolu.
        </p>
        <p> So after we talked that night (1st of january), i felt weird, i kept thinking about you the entire day during
            wtv i was doing. I couldnt shake of the memory of giving all of my firsts, EVEN THOUGH on texts, to someone 
            912km far. I kept thinking about you becuase i had never ever had such an interaction with anyone in my 
            entire life that too a guy?? never. Matlab aap yakeen karen out of my family i talk to only limitted guys 
            acche se (and that limitted nmber can be counted on a single hand), and trust me when i say you're the ONLY 
            boy i have ever liked THIS badly. 
        </p>
        <p> Uss raat ko jaise aapne baatein kari, jaise sab kuch apne hota chala gya, idk i just liked it sm. But i was 
            so skeptical about it all becuase obv i didnt even know you tab. Fir on 5th of jan when you admitted you lied 
            to me, i was so idk broken becuase obv you were the first guy to trust and you broke the trust. But i didnt want
            to block you becuase wo fir bohot rude hota toh i thought of deactivating and didnt plan on opeing insta till i 
            forgot about you and you forgot about me too. Lekin in 5 days i started liking you and not talking to you was not 
            happening mujhse toh i activated insta and tab you had apologized so nicely toh fir i forgave you and fir i started
            really liking you.
        </p>
        <p> After that we started our aisi waise baatien often, din ho raat ho whenever. I used to keep thinking about you 
            all the time and i wondered if you really like me was it all bas aise hi time pass and you just enjoyed the 
            attention you got out of talking to me (i still wonder). I really started liking you but i fel we drifting away
            and slowly we were ending when you stopped talking to me during boards wala waqt. I knew you didnt like me anymore 
            and honestly you never even did and it was all a show, i dumb idiotic prank. But then i was so occupied in studies
            and everything that i didnt think much and whenever i would be free, my mind would automatically land at the thought
            of you and i, or rather the you and i: i had in my mind and the one which was untrue. Uss waqt i knew you didnt use
            your discord much and i knew ke i could text you there and you would read those texs. So i thought i would text you 
            waha because i knew that we were ending and that you would stop talking to me any day, i j wanted you to have a 
            closure jab bhi you open discord even galti se.
        </p>
        <p> Suprisingly, you never went and you also read dis wale texts and then we started talking talking dubara. Also 
            um, ek choti si raaz ki baat batati hoon mai aapko, please dont be mad at me im really sorry but i had to, so 
            um do you remember the drunkendard karke id which texted you one day, so um i made that id to see if you were 
            actually busy or j not replying to me specifically. Fir i saw your replies to that id and not mine and i was 
            so idk heart broken ke aap ek random ajnabi ladki se baat kar rhe hain and not me. Fir everything was so bad mere
            pov se, evvery text you sent after that was a reminder of how you never even liked me and it was all j a game of 
            yours. But wtv after everything got sorted, we got back to normal and everything was fine. I even tried to 
            shake off everything from my mind and i might as well be successful in doing that. 
        </p>
        <p> I really love you so much and i would love you the same way till my very last breath. Okay ew that was so cliche
            but wtv i do mean it bahahaha.
        </p>
