        <p>My Love,</p>

        <p>i know we wouldn't talk everyday abse since you're getting into college plus rn also aap busy. the shift from everything to so little has been excruciatingly painful to see and feel, but I am sure nothing would change and I will still be yours like I always was.
        </p>

        <p>if something does change, we are only going to get closer and better together. growing up and having you by my side has always been a blessing and the best part of my life. having you as a constant, has only instilled trust and belongingness in me. i have always liked you for you even when others thought your replies were so dry or you were so rude, i always knew you weren't and I trust you immensely and i promise I wouldn't ever break YOUR trust in me. 
        </p>
        
        <p> i hope when you move to college, you find new people (only boys allowed) and you have a great time and everything but I wish nothing changes between us and the way we were because I cannot let anything between us change because I cannot afford to lose you ever ever. 
        </p>
         
        <p>i love you sm, even when you wouldn't say it back i still love, and i would love you even when you wouldn't love me back and even when we don't talk or even if (shouldnt happen) we stop talking at all. i will always love you and keep waiting for you no matter what.
        </p>

        <p> i hope you have a great birthday, a great year and a great life ahead with me (and even the slightest of chances,) without me.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">with all my heart, <br> mwaaah</p>
