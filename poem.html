        <div class="stanza">
            <p>From the first hello to the quiet goodnights,</p>
            <p>You've been the dream that colors my nights.</p>
            <p>Not just a boy, but my closest friend,</p>
            <p>In you, my heart found its perfect blend.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Your smile, a sound that brightens the day,</p>
            <p>A simple giggle takes my breath away.</p>
            <p>You've built a world where I feel safe,</p>
            <p>Where love and laughter have their place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>In the little things, I see your love,</p>
            <p>In every text, in stars above.</p>
            <p>The way you laugh, the way you care,</p>
            <p>It's a beauty beyond what words can share.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>With every moment, I find more to adore,</p>
            <p>The way you speak, the love I implore.</p>
            <p>I promise to love you, always and more,</p>
            <p>With every moment, every door.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>No distance too far, no time too long,</p>
            <p>Fate will keep us where we belong.</p>
            <p>But in each conversation, and every night,</p>
            <p>You remind me, love always feels right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>We don't need words, we don't need sound,</p>
            <p>In your love, I'm truly found.</p>
            <p>A quiet connection, a soft embrace,</p>
            <p>Forever, I'll cherish our sacred space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Just you and me, in our own space,</p>
            <p>Where time slows down, and hearts embrace.</p>
            <p>A love that's simple, yet so deep,</p>
            <p>A bond that's ours, ours to keep.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Through time, through changes, I'll stay with you,</p>
            <p>In every moment, I'll love you true.</p>
            <p>For as long as the stars continue to shine,</p>
            <p>I'll always be yours, and you'll always be mine.</p>
